<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is the Readme for the <span class="bold">ICU (LEGO Island Configuration Utility)</span>, a <a href="http://python.org" target="_blank" title="Python 
(Programming Language)">Python 3</a> application to to a provide a collection of tools for the 1997 Mindscape PC game <a href="
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Island" target="_blank"><span class="italic">LEGO Island</span></a>.</p><a name="How"></a>

<h2>ICU Windower</h2>
<h3 id="appname">Usage</h3>
<p>You have downloaded the <span class="bold">ICU Windower</span> component of <span class="bold">ICU</span>. This small tool, rewritten from the original 
Inno Setup version,<br>automatically enables Windowed Mode and restores the Full Screen Mode, the former of which is a semi-hidden feature of <span class=
"italic">LEGO Island</span>.</p>

<p>Simply click <span class="italic">Launch ICU Windower.bat</span> to launch <span class="bold">ICU Windower</span>. This release supports both 32- and 
64-bit Windows, so there is no need to choose the correct one.<br>You will need Administrator rights to run <span class="bold">ICU Windower</span>, as they 
are needed to write to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE section of the Registry.</p>

<p>This release automatically sets the Ramp Emulation Game Graphics setting and all other required settings so so Windowed Mode will activate.
<br>It also asks you if you would like to use Ramp Emulation or MMX Emulation when restoring Full Screen Mode, as well as other Game Graphics settings.</p>

<p>From version 2.0 onward, you are able to launch <span class="italic">LEGO Island</span> after you activate either Windowed or Full 
Screen mode.</p>

<p>As of version 2.0.1, you are able to manually select a <span class="italic">LEGO Island</span> installation if the auto-detection or game launching fails. 
However, if you do need to use this feature,<br>you will have to select the installation every time, as it is not stored between launches. This annoying 
limitation is planned to be fixed in a future release.</p>

<p class="bold">Do note that Windowed Mode is inherently buggy, and it will not activate all the time, or maybe not at all, simply because a method to always activate it is still being developed.
<br>If you experience this, please follow the same steps you would to report a bug.</p>
