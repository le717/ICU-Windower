# ICU Windower #
**ICU Windower** automatically enables the hidden Windowed Mode and restores normal Full Screen Mode in the 1997 Mindscape PC game [*LEGO Island*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Island).

## Usage ##
Simply click `Launch ICU Windower.bat` to launch ICU Windower . This tool supports both 32- and 64-bit Windows, so there is no need to choose the correct one. You will need Administrator rights to run ICU Windower , as they are needed to write to the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` section of the Registry.

Do note that windowed mode will not activate all the time, or maybe not at all. This stems from an imperfect method to always activate it. In additon, windowed mode is [terribly buggy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYaa-vktcqI).
